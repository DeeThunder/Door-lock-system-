Project Overview:
In this project, the keypad inputs a code displayed on the LCD screen. The ESP32 chip processes this input, activating the servo motor to unlock the door when the correct code is entered. This system not only bolsters home security but also offers an immersive dive into IoT and electrical engineering realms.
Steps Involved:
1. Setup and Wiring: Initiate by connecting the keypad, servo motor, and LCD display to the ESP32 chip with jumper wires on a breadboard.
2. Programming the ESP32: Script and upload code to the ESP32 for handling keypad inputs, displaying data on the LCD, and controlling the servo motor.
3. Testing and Debugging: Thoroughly test the system with various inputs to ensure precise servo motor responses to the correct code.
4. Final Assembly: Once functional, integrate the components into a stable configuration suitable for door installation.
Challenges Faced:
1. Learning EEPROM Use: Mastery of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read-Only Memory) was pivotal, ensuring saved codes retain integrity despite power cycling.
2. Cable Management: Accurate cable connections management averted hardware glitches, demanding meticulous oversight.
3. Code Refinement: Iterative refinement of the code streamlined operations for enhanced efficiency and user-friendliness.
4. Materials Sourcing: Careful sourcing of materials for assembling a well-packaged DIY kit, incorporating robust carton packaging for secure component containment.
Future Enhancements:
- Custom PCB Design: Pioneering a custom PCB streamlines and tidies up connections, eliminating jumper wire clutter.
- 3D Model Packaging: Crafting a user-centric 3D model for commercial packaging heightens accessibility and appeal.
- Customization: Further tailoring potential with mechanical keypad and biometric authentication.
Why This Project?
- Educational Value: Unravel microcontrollers, coding nuances, and electronic circuit intricacies.
- Practical Application: Yielding a tangible outcome, fortifying home defense.
- Customization: Further tailoring potential with WiFi connectivity, mobile app integration, or biometric authentication.
